Welcome to the CESM Simpler Models github repo.
================================

We will be populating the repo with useful information about current and developmental configurations of CESM. As we do so, we will try to keep the documentation up to date. Documentation can be found in the [gh-pages branch](http://ncar.github.io/simpler_models/doc/build/html/index.html) of the repository.

The Simpler Models project *is not* a software package.

Please use the "issues" feature of github to discuss all aspects of CESM simpler models. Use labels to mark your issues to alert interested parties. The "issues" can be ideas for new configurations, questions about current configurations, discussion of developmental configurations, actual software issues, etc. Also, thoughts for how we should use this repository; including what form the documentation web pages should take versus what should the wiki contain and what kind of code/information/recipes/data/etc should be hosted.
