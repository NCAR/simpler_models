Welcome to the CESM Simpler Models github repo.

We will be populating the repo with useful information about current and developmental configurations of CESM. As we do so, we will try to keep the documentation up to date. Documentation can be found in the [gh-pages branch](http://ncar.github.io/simpler_models/doc/build/html/index.html) of the repository.
