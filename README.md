CESM Simpler Models Configurations

Notes
-----

* Please see Introduction.md for the overview of the simpler_models
  repository and resources, including background information.
* Documentation is maintained in the gh-pages branch. It is written in
RST and converted to html using sphinx.
* Use the "Issues" github tab for discussion topics. Please use tags
to identify the configuration that is relevant to your issue.
* Note that at this point "simpler_models" is **not** a software
  package. This respository may host some associated code, but the
  intention is to provide a "community center" for discussion and 
  documentation of the simpler model configurations for CESM.
