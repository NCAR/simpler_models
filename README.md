CESM Simpler Models Configurations

Notes
-----
* Please see [Introduction.md](https://github.com/NCAR/simpler_models/blob/master/Introduction.md) for the overview of the simpler_models
  repository and resources, including background information.
* Documentation is maintained in the gh-pages branch. It is written in
RST and converted to html using sphinx. Here is the link to the [top of
the documentation](http://ncar.github.io/simpler_models/doc/build/html/index.html).
* Use the "Issues" github tab for discussion topics. Please use tags
to identify the configuration that is relevant to your issue.
* Note that at this point "simpler_models" is **not** a software
  package. This respository hosts some associated code, but the
  intention is to provide a "community center" for discussion and 
  documentation of the simpler model configurations for CESM.
