*Supported Configurations

**Dry adiabatic dynamical cores
In directory dabi are scripts for generating initial conditions (dabiic) and testing (dabitest) the dry adiabatic dynamical core configurations. These were developed by Isla Simpson, see also the [simpler models page](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/simpler-models/dry-dynamical-core.html).
