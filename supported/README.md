Supported Configurations
===============================

Dry adiabatic dynamical cores
-----------------------------------
In directory dabi are scripts for generating initial conditions (dabiic) and testing (dabitest) the dry adiabatic dynamical core configurations. These were developed by Isla Simpson, see also the [simpler models page](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/simpler-models/dry-dynamical-core.html).

Held-Suarez (1994)
------------------
In the directory HS94 is a test for the Held-Suarez idealized physics configuration provided by Isla Simpson.

Aquaplanets
-----------
See the  [simpler models page](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/simpler-models/aquaplanet.html) for details. There are instructions for setting up aquaplanet configurations with CESM1. We plan to migrate those instructions to this repository for archival/legacy purposes and update to CESM2 instructions upon release.
